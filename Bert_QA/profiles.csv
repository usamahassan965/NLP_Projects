https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Rebecca.Addo,Rebecca Addo,"Rebecca Addo is a Research Fellow at CHERE.

Her interest in the field of health economics began when she started working as a hospital nurse in Ghana.

“I realised that there were a lot of things we needed to work with on the ward that we didn’t have resources for,” Dr Addo said.

“There were also conditions that could be prevented before they got to hospital.”

This prompted her to complete her Master of Public Health degree from the University of Ghana, before coming to UTS in 2015 to complete a PhD in health economics.

Her PhD thesis focused on assessing the feasibility of a developing country (Ghana), constrained with human and data resources, to conduct and use Health Technology Assessment (HTA) for health decision making. Her thesis found that it was feasible for Ghana to conduct and use HTA in their health system when the identified barriers and challenges such as limited human and data capacity and lack of knowledge of HTA. The thesis also highlighted that limited data for HTA in Ghana, meant relying on international data in the short to medium term, however, these data need to be transformed to be context-specific before they are suitable for use in an economic evaluation.

Currently, Rebecca’s main research interests include, priority setting in health, HTA, and the application of HTA methods to health care decisions in developing countries and development and measurement of health outcomes.

She has skills in mixed research methods including economic modelling, systematic literature reviews, and stakeholder engagements through qualitative research methods.

In her current position, Rebecca is part of the Economic Evaluation team that critically appraises economic evaluations for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) and Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC). Rebecca conducts health technology assessment for the MSAC and other external bodies such as the Singapore Agency for Care Effectiveness. Rebecca also works with the Quality of Life team on the development and psychometric testing of health outcome measures such as EQ-5D-5L and its bolt-on descriptors. Her work in this area involves working with researchers internationally, in the UK and Ghana. In addition to research work, Rebecca teaches health economics subjects offered in the university.

“Companies submit data on a new drug, and we evaluate what has been presented for the Department of Health,” she said.

“We look at the data so see if the drug does what it does, models, the safety and effectiveness of the drug, whether the government should fund it and how much it will cost the government in the first six years.”

Previously, Rebecca has worked as a general nurse and as a lecturer in nursing and public health institutions located in Ghana, and as a tutor in health economics at UTS, Australia. Rebecca also has experience in teaching undergraduate and postgraduate students in public health, health economics, and nursing both in Ghana and Australia..

https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Muhammad.Afzal,Muhammad Afzal,"Muhammad Usman Afzal is a senior IEEE member and working as a Research Fellow at University of Technology Sydney. He received the Bachelor in Electronics Engineering and Masters in Computational Science and Engineering from the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Islamabad, in 2009 and 2011, respectively. He has completed PhD in Electronics Engineering from Macquarie University, Australia, in 2017.

Muhammad doctoral research led to two breakthroughs in the field of electromagnetics and antennas. His work on near-field phase-correction is a game-changing practical design approach to develop low-profile high-gain antennas as this method uses actual electric field (vectors) phase and not the ray tracing technique, traditionally used in phase-correcting lenses. The method provides freedom to a designer in performing phase correction at a distance as close to as half of the free-space wavelength spacing from antenna, which is traditionally performed in the far-field regions or at least 3-5 wavelengths spacing. His second contribution is the development of near-field meta-steering (NFMS) technology, which is an IP protected invention. This technology yields beam-steering antenna systems that are superior to both electronically steered active phased arrays and all mechanically steered/tilted reflector dishes or flat panel antennas. His innovative work on beam-steering technology received the “Highly Commended” certificate in the Five Future-Shaping Research Priorities category in the 2017 Academic Staff Awards at Macquarie University. 

Muhammad has been working in the field of electromagnetics and antennas for more than ten years. He started his career as a Lab Engineer in 2010 at Research Institute for Microwave & Millimetre-Wave Studies (RIMMS) NUST, Islamabad. In 2012, he was promoted to the position of lecturer, which he continued till Feb 2013. In 2017, after PhD, he was offered a post-doctorate for three years on a project funded by the Australian Research Council (ARC) through the Discovery grant scheme at Macquarie University. Since 2020 he has been working as a Research Fellow at University of Technology Sydney. Muhammad is an active researcher and has been publishing more than ten research papers each year and also involved in research supervision. In the last five years, Muhammad co-supervised: five PhD, three Masters of research, and several undergraduate thesis students.

[Health in the urban environment: Exploring residents views and system understandings within the building context in Sydney, Australia, using a complex systems health and wellbeing framework] explores the complexity of residents views of health and wellbeing within high-density apartment living in Sydney. In the face of the many dimensions, challenges, and future trends seen affecting apartment living and beyond, the research explores the complexities of such factors from the perspective of those affected the most, residents of apartment buildings and takes into consideration our health's dependency on the natural environment. To understand this complexity, the research challenges linear and narrow ways of thinking about the drivers of health and wellbeing and uses holistic and ecological thinking to explore such complexities.
